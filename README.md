For the CECS 3210 course's final proyect

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The GUI was constructed using the PAGE GUI generator, which permitted us as a team
to generate the skeleton of the GUI and then generate the respective Tkinter modules,
which then allowed us to give it our desired function

Graph.py is the module that takes a python list and a Tkinter canvas as parameter
and then creates a bar graph on the canvas

SortingAlgos.py is the module that takes a list, a Tkinter canvas and a sorting speed.
This will then visualize the sorting on the canvas by iteration

InfoWin is the module that takes a sorting algorithm as parameter and creates a
window displaying the technical information of the specified sorting algorithm

SortingGUI and support.py were the files generated by the PAGE generator, and we gave
it our desired functions to make our program Event-Driven
